# Applying_Stochastic_Subgradient_Descent_to_Machine_Learning_Methods
Repository for all experimental work conducted in my honours thesis, Applying Stochastic Subgradient Descent to Machine Learning Methods

## Source Code

The main code can be run from ```testing.py```. This will run the functions defined in ```test_functions.py``` using the Stochastic Subgradient Descent algorithm defined in ```algorithms.py```.

## Results

The individual results themslves are not uploaded, but ```summary.csv``` outlines the important components and features of the runs. This file was generated using ```summary_calc.py```.

## Thesis

The honours thesis itself can also be found here.
